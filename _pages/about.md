I am a senior undergraduate at the University of Mumbai, pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, with a Technical High School Diploma in Computer Engineering from K. J. Somaiya Polytechnic, Mumbai.

My research focuses on Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Medical AI, with an emphasis on AI-driven automation and scientific computing. I have collaborated with Xu Lab at Carnegie Mellon University under Prof. Min Xu and Xiangrui (Taylor) Zeng on segmentation map registration for MRI images, and with Dr. Clément Coïc (Siemens Healthineers) on modeling robotic systems using Julia SciML. Currently, I am working in collaboration with Prof. Hyunjae Gil on Vision‑IMU‑Based Virtual Environment for Children.

I am seeking opportunities for direct PhD or integrated MS‑PhD positions for Fall 2026. Please feel free to reach out via email for collaboration or discussion of opportunities. 

## Research Interest
My research focuses on developing principled and scalable AI systems that bridge machine learning theory and real-world impact, with emphasis on robotics, healthcare, and intelligent virtual environments. My primary interests include:

- Humanoid Robotics and Embodied AI - Modeling, simulation, and learning of humanoid systems, with interest in training embodied agents in high-fidelity simulation environments (e.g., Omniverse) for intelligent perception, control, and adaptation.

- Medical AI and Computational Biology - Applying deep learning to understand complex biological and anatomical systems, including brain structure and neural processes, with particular interest in medical imaging and data-driven cancer research.

- Intelligent 3D, AR/VR, and Simulation Environments - Developing interactive 3D and immersive environments augmented with learning-based intelligence, autonomous agents, and task-specific language models.
