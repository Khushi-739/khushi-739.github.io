I am a senior undergraduate pursuing a Bachelor of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at the University of Mumbai. I have also completed a Technical High School Diploma in Computer Engineering from K. J. Somaiya Polytechnic, Mumbai.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Medical AI, with a growing focus on AI-driven automation and scientific computing.
I have previously collaborated at Xu Lab, Carnegie Mellon University, advised by Prof. Min Xu, working under the guidance of Xiangrui (Taylor) Zeng on segmentation map registration for MRI images.
Additionally, I collaborated with Dr. Clément Coïc (Siemens Healthineers) on modeling robotic systems using Julia SciML.

My goal is to contribute to research that bridges AI theory and real-world impact through interdisciplinary collaboration. I am always open to research discussions and collaborative opportunities feel free to reach out via email if our interests align.

I am on the job market this year and also considering direct PhD positions. I would be happy to discuss any opportunities that may be a good fit.
